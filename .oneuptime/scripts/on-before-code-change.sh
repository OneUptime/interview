# Some of the common tasks you can do here are:
# 1. Install dependencies
# 2. Run any other command that you want to run before the code is changed.
# If this script fails, copilot will not make any changes to the code.
# This step is to ensure that the code is in a good state before we start making changes.
# If you want to skip this script, you can keep this file empty.
# It's highly recommended to run things like installing dependencies in this script.
# This scirpt will run on ubuntu machine. So, make sure the commands you run are compatible with ubuntu.

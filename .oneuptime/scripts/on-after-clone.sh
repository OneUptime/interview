# Description: Copilot clones your repository and to improve your code. 
# This scirpt runs after the clone process is completed.
# Some of the common tasks you can do here are:
# 1. Install dependencies
# 2. Run linting
# 3. Run tests
# 4. Run build
# 5. Run any other command that you want to run after the clone process is completed.
# If this script fails, copilot will not proceed with the next steps to improve your code.
# This step is to ensure that the code is in a good state before we start improving it.
# If you want to skip this script, you can keep this file empty.
# It's highly recommended to run linting and tests in this script to ensure the code is in a good state.
# This scirpt will run on ubuntu machine. So, make sure the commands you run are compatible with ubuntu.

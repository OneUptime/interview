# Description: Copilot will run this script after we make improvements to your code and write it to disk.
# Some of the common tasks you can do here are:
# 1. Run linting
# 2. Run tests
# 3. Run build
# 4. Run any other command that you want to run after the code is changed.
# If this script fails, copilot will not commit the changes to your repository.
# This step is to ensure that the code is in a good state before we commit the changes.
# If you want to skip this script, you can keep this file empty.
# It's highly recommended to run linting and tests in this script to ensure the code is in a good state.
# This scirpt will run on ubuntu machine. So, make sure the commands you run are compatible with ubuntu.
